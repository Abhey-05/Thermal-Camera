Thermal Cameras are widely used in a wide range of industrial applications such as thermal performance monitoring, detecting temperature anomalies, thermal bench marking and many more. We even use thermal imaging even for defense and military applications. The most common application that we may come across, is might be the electronics repair industry. In repair industry the thermal cameras are a very important tool which can make the hardware debugging much easier especially where there are shorted parts are involved. The main concern regarding such thermal imager is that they are pretty expensive. So, in this project we are going to find some solution for that by making a DIY thermal imager using much cheaper available components.

-40 to 85°C operational temperature range.
Adjustable refresh rate – 4Hz – 32Hz.
10 different colour pallets.
2.4” TFT display with 320x240 resolution.
Save thermal image to SD card.
Built-in battery and charging circuit.
